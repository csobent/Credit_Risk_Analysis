# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

For this challenge, we have been asked to create a machine learning model to help determine credit card risk. While using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub and the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries, we will: 1) build and evaluate models using resampling, 2) oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE alrogithms and undersample using the ClusterCentroids algorithms, 3) use a combinatorial approach using the SMOTEENN algorithm, and 4) compare the machine learning models that reduce bias and predict credit risk.
